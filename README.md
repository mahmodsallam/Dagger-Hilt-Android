# Dagger-Hilt-Android
## Project Overview

Simple demo App for using the new Google library **Hilt** for dependency injection 

This app uses the API from [mockapi.io](https://5e510330f2c0d300147c034c.mockapi.io)
 
 
## Why this project 

**Hilt** is the latest attempt from Google to attempt to prevent you from cutting yourself when using Dagger.
So i decided to try it out in a small demo app 

## What I learned
- Hilt for dependency injection.
- Understand some concepts in Dagger2.
- Incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write.

## Use case
A component is an interface, which is annotated with @Component and takes modules in it. But now, this annotation is not required in Dagger-Hilt.
